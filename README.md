# 1ndependence.vim

Simplified version of [vim-independence](https://github.com/AD7six/vim-independence), which always loads `.vimrc` from git root if exist.

Plugin renamed to `1ndependence.vim` to make sure that project's `.vimrc` will get loaded before loading other plugins (unless you got a plugin named `0h-no`).

## Installation

### Pathogen

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
